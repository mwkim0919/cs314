Part 2:
For Part 2 of the assignment, I have created dynamic cube mapping so
that the leftmost sphere, the cube, and the tetrahedron would 
reflect the background scene and objects. Also for the rightmost
sphere, I have created shaders that displaces the vertices of the sphere
according to red color value of the texture given to the shader and uses
the normal of the vertices to set the surface color.
